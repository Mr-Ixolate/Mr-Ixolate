# Hello there
- I’m interested in data science and sustainability
- Currently learning python data science and a few other bits and pieces
- Working on a small discord bot using discord.py ( I keep running into things I didn't realise were going to be problems or that are better but will need me to re-write large chunks of code, pretty good fun overall, at least now I can use unittest)
- You can reach me by performing an arcane ritual and sacrificing a small egg

## Observe my Incredible Porfolio:

greeting.py
```py
print('hello world')
```
